# Stock Price Prediction | Time-series Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using time-series forecasting techniques. It involves constructing a Python script that leverages historical closing price data to forecast future prices. The project focuses on implementing the XGBoostRegressor algorithm to predict closing prices for the next month.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Python for scripting and data analysis.
- Gathers historical closing price data spanning 5 years using Pandas data reader.
- Implements the XGBoostRegressor algorithm for time-series forecasting.
- Predicts stock prices for the next 1 month based on historical data.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Python script `forecast.py`.

## Usage
1. Open `forecast.py` in your preferred Python environment.
2. Modify the script to specify the desired stock symbol and time frame for analysis.
3. Run the script to gather historical data and generate stock price predictions.
4. Review the output to analyze the forecasted stock prices.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- XGBoost
